# crab-ms
A bullet hell game with a crab suffering from effects of multiple sclerosis as the protagonist.

# What is crab-ms?
As the subtitle says, crab-ms is a bullet hell shooter game written completely in Python in which you play as a crab avoiding a swarm of squid that shoot ink at you, stalker fish, and killer jellyfish! Thankfully, you're able to throw pebbles at an extremely fast pace, scaring off the predators that you hit. Unfortunately, you're a crab that suffers from some common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (hence the "ms" in the name) like loss of balance, fatigue, and loss of vision. 

### What do these ailments mean to the player?
* Loss of balance - the controls for movement are randomized for a short period of time
* Fatigue - you move slower for a short period of time
* Loss of vision - a vignette effect covers the screen, limiting the amount you're able to see

### How to play?
To install, just download the source files. You'll need python and pygame installed. If you have those, just run ``game_runner.py``!

### Controls
* WASD or Arrow Keys to move the crab
* Mouse to aim the pebbles (you automatically throw pebbles)
